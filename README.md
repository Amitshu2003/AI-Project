## Abstract
### Handwritten character recognition is an issue in Optical  Character Recognition (OCR), in this project we aim to develop an AI system that helps to properly recognize hand written characters. Handwritten character recognition(HCR) can be implemented using CNN to recognize the characters from the written text image and the accuracy of recognition with training and testing.
